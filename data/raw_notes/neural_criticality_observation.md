## Purification
Beggs and Plenz (2003) recorded spontaneous activity in organotypic cortical cultures — slices of rat cortex maintained in vitro. The preparation strips away sensory input, motor output, and neuromodulatory context. What remains is the intrinsic dynamics of a local cortical network: approximately 10,000 neurons communicating through excitatory and inhibitory synapses. This purification of the system to its essential dynamical components is what made the discovery possible — without external drive, the network's own organizational principles become visible.

## Containment
The multi-electrode array (60 electrodes, 200 um spacing) defines the observational container. It samples a patch of cortex small enough that signal propagation delays are negligible, yet large enough to capture spatiotemporal patterns spanning the network. The culture dish provides physical containment; the recording apparatus provides informational containment. Local field potentials are thresholded to identify "active" electrodes at each time step, discretizing the continuous neural dynamics into a lattice-like representation amenable to statistical physics analysis.

## Anchoring
The branching ratio sigma serves as the anchor — the single control parameter that determines the dynamical regime. sigma = (number of active descendants) / (number of active ancestors), averaged over many cascades. sigma < 1: subcritical, activity dies out. sigma > 1: supercritical, activity explodes. sigma = 1: critical, activity propagates without amplification or attenuation. This parameter persists through all the complexity of synaptic transmission, providing an invariant reference point for characterizing the network's operating regime.

## Dissolution
When the branching ratio exceeds 1, the network enters a supercritical regime where small perturbations trigger runaway excitation — analogous to an epileptic seizure. The structured spatiotemporal patterns dissolve into global synchronization. Information processing capacity actually decreases in this regime because every input produces the same saturating response. The "dissolution" here is pathological — loss of the fine structure needed for computation. The healthy brain must avoid this regime while remaining near it.

## Liminality
At sigma = 1, the cortical network exhibits neuronal avalanches: cascades of activity whose size and duration follow power-law distributions P(s) ~ s^{-3/2} and P(d) ~ d^{-2}. These exponents match the mean-field branching process universality class. The network is maximally sensitive to inputs (dynamic range is maximized), information transmission is optimized, and the repertoire of distinct activity patterns is largest. This is the liminal state — the brain operating at the edge of a phase transition between quiescence and runaway excitation.

## Encounter
The discovery that living neural tissue self-organizes to the critical point was unexpected. Unlike the Ising model where temperature must be externally tuned, cortical networks appear to achieve criticality through homeostatic plasticity mechanisms — synaptic scaling, short-term depression, inhibitory balance. The system actively maintains itself at the critical point. This "self-organized criticality" (though distinct from the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile) suggests that the brain has evolved to exploit the computational advantages of the critical regime.

## Integration
The mean-field critical exponents (tau=3/2, alpha=2, gamma_sd=2) connect cortical dynamics to the broader framework of statistical mechanics. The same scaling relations that govern percolation on Bethe lattices govern information flow in cortical networks. This integration is not metaphorical — the mathematical structure is identical. Finite-size scaling analysis of avalanches in networks of different sizes confirms the same scaling collapse observed in physical phase transitions.

## Emergence
Consciousness itself may be an emergent property of critical neural dynamics. Tagliazucchi et al (2012) showed that the resting-state fMRI signal in awake subjects exhibits scale-free avalanche dynamics, while this criticality is lost under propofol anesthesia — the system becomes subcritical. If awareness requires the maximal sensitivity, information integration, and dynamic range that criticality provides, then consciousness emerges at a phase transition in neural activity, not from any particular neural structure.
