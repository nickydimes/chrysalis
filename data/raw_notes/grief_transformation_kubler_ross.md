## Purification
The onset of grief strips away the assumptions that structured the bereaved person's world. Parkes (1971) called this the destruction of the "assumptive world" — the implicit model of reality that includes the deceased as a living presence. The shock phase serves as purification: normal cognitive processing is suspended, routine activities become meaningless, and the bereaved may experience derealization or depersonalization. This is not pathology but the system's initial response to a catastrophic perturbation — the equivalent of thermal quenching past a phase transition. The old world-model cannot accommodate the new reality and must be dismantled before reconstruction can begin.

## Containment
Mourning rituals across cultures provide containment for the dissolution of the bereaved's identity. The Jewish shiva confines mourners to the home for seven days, with the community providing food and companionship. The Hindu antyesti prescribes a thirteen-day sequence of rituals with specific acts for each day. The Victorian mourning period imposed external structure (black clothing, social withdrawal, defined timeframes) on an internal process. Stroebe and Schut's (1999) dual process model describes oscillation between "loss-oriented coping" (confronting the grief) and "restoration-oriented coping" (attending to practical tasks) — a dynamic containment that prevents either total immersion in grief or total avoidance.

## Anchoring
Klass, Silverman, and Nickman (1996) challenged the Freudian "grief work" model that demanded complete detachment from the deceased. Their research on "continuing bonds" showed that healthy grief involves maintaining an inner relationship with the deceased that is transformed, not severed. The continuing bond serves as the anchor: the relationship persists through the dissolution of its external form. The deceased becomes an internalized presence — a reference point that provides continuity through the radical reorganization of the survivor's identity and daily life.

## Dissolution
The acute grief response involves the dissolution of established patterns at every level. Behavioral: routines built around the deceased person collapse. Cognitive: plans, expectations, and goals that assumed the deceased's presence become invalid. Somatic: grief produces measurable physiological disruption — elevated cortisol, disrupted sleep architecture, immune suppression, and in severe cases, stress cardiomyopathy ("broken heart syndrome"). Social: the bereaved person's role in their social network is disrupted, as relationships that were mediated through the deceased must be renegotiated or abandoned.

## Liminality
The bereaved person occupies a liminal social position. They are no longer who they were (a spouse, a parent of a living child) but not yet who they will become. In many cultures, the mourning period explicitly marks this liminality with altered appearance and social rules. The bereaved may experience intrusive images, vivid dreams of the deceased, and a sense of the deceased's presence — phenomena that suggest the cognitive system is at maximal sensitivity, searching for the missing person in every signal. This heightened sensitivity is the psychological analogue of divergent susceptibility at a critical point.

## Encounter
In the liminal space of grief, the bereaved may encounter new aspects of the deceased, of themselves, and of the nature of love and mortality. Post-traumatic growth research (Tedeschi & Calhoun 2004) documents that many bereaved individuals report: greater appreciation for life, new possibilities for themselves, increased personal strength, improved relationships, and spiritual/existential change. These are not compensations for the loss but genuinely new configurations of meaning that were inaccessible from within the prior assumptive world. The encounter requires the dissolution of the old framework.

## Integration
Integration in grief is not "getting over" the loss but reorganizing life around the loss as a permanent feature of one's history. Worden (2009) describes this as "finding an enduring connection with the deceased in the midst of embarking on a new life." The continuing bond is renegotiated: the internalized relationship with the deceased becomes a stable structure in the survivor's psychological landscape. New routines, new relationships, and new meaning-structures are built — not to replace the old ones but to constitute a genuinely new configuration.

## Emergence
The person who emerges from profound grief is qualitatively different from the person who entered it. This is not recovery in the sense of returning to baseline — it is transformation. The new configuration may include: a reorganized sense of identity (widow/widower as a new social category, not merely the absence of the old one), a deepened capacity for empathy, a changed relationship to mortality and meaning, and new relational patterns. The emergence is not guaranteed — grief can become "complicated" or "prolonged" when the dissolution proceeds without adequate containment or when the system becomes stuck in the liminal phase. But when the full sequence is traversed, the result is genuine emergence.
