## Purification
The set and setting protocol in psychedelic-assisted therapy is a deliberate purification process. Participants undergo multiple preparatory sessions with trained therapists to address expectations, fears, and intentions. The dosing environment is carefully controlled: comfortable room, curated music playlist, eyeshades to reduce external visual input. The pharmacological agent (psilocybin, LSD, MDMA) then acts as the physical purification mechanism — dissolving the default mode network (DMN) activity that maintains the habitual self-model. Carhart-Harris describes this as a "relaxation of the precision weighting on prior beliefs."

## Containment
The therapeutic container has multiple layers. Physical: the dosing room, the presence of two trained therapists, the carefully sequenced music. Pharmacological: the known dose, the predictable time course (onset, peak, return). Psychological: the therapeutic alliance built over preparatory sessions, the agreed-upon intention for the experience. Neurological: the brain's own homeostatic mechanisms that limit the duration and extent of serotonergic disruption. Without containment, the same pharmacological dissolution that enables therapeutic breakthrough can produce a "bad trip" — uncontained dissolution leading to panic, not transformation.

## Anchoring
The therapeutic intention serves as the anchor. Participants are guided to formulate a specific question or theme before the session — "What is the source of my depression?" or "What am I avoiding?" This intention persists through the dissolution of normal cognitive frameworks, providing a direction for the experience without constraining its content. The music playlist serves as a temporal anchor — a structured progression from grounding (session start) through building intensity (onset) to emotional peak and gradual resolution. The therapist's occasional verbal reassurance ("You are safe, this is the medicine working") provides a relational anchor to consensual reality.

## Dissolution
Under psilocybin (25mg), fMRI studies show dramatic reduction in DMN connectivity, particularly in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) — the hub that normally maintains the autobiographical self-narrative. The entropic brain hypothesis (Carhart-Harris 2014) proposes that psychedelics increase the entropy of spontaneous cortical activity, moving the brain from a subcritical regime (dominated by a few high-amplitude, low-frequency attractors — habitual thought patterns) toward criticality. Depression, addiction, and OCD are reconceptualized as states of excessive order — pathologically deep attractors that resist perturbation. The psychedelic dissolves these attractors.

## Liminality
At peak effect (~2-3 hours post-ingestion), participants report experiences consistent with the liminal state: dissolution of self-other boundaries (ego dissolution), time distortion, synesthesia, access to usually unconscious emotional material. Neuroimaging shows increased connectivity between brain regions that normally don't communicate (increased global functional connectivity), increased signal complexity (Lempel-Ziv complexity), and a flattening of the brain's normally hierarchical dynamics. The REBUS (RElaxed Beliefs Under pSychedelics) model describes this as the brain entering a state of maximal sensitivity where previously rigid prior beliefs can be revised.

## Encounter
In the liminal state, participants frequently report encounters with insights that feel fundamentally inaccessible from their normal state of consciousness. In depression trials, common themes include: vivid re-experiencing of formative emotional events with new perspective, a felt sense of connectedness to others and to nature, and direct confrontation with avoided emotional material. These are not "hallucinations" in the trivial sense — they are access to cognitive-emotional configurations that the normally over-constrained system could not reach. The therapeutic mechanism is precisely this encounter with novel internal structure.

## Integration
Post-session integration is considered essential to therapeutic outcome. In the days and weeks following the acute experience, participants work with therapists to "make sense of" the material encountered during the session — connecting it to their life narrative, extracting actionable insights, and establishing new behavioral patterns. The "afterglow" period (1-2 weeks post-session) shows increased brain plasticity (elevated BDNF, increased dendritic spine density) — a neurobiological window during which new patterns can consolidate. Without structured integration, the insights of the liminal state may not persist.

## Emergence
Clinical trial data shows that a single psilocybin session produces rapid, sustained remission of treatment-resistant depression in approximately 60% of participants (Carhart-Harris et al 2021). The new psychological configuration — characterized by increased openness, reduced rumination, and greater emotional flexibility — cannot be reached by incremental adjustment of the depressive state. It requires dissolution of the old attractor landscape and crystallization around new attractors. The transformation has the character of a phase transition: discontinuous, requiring a threshold perturbation, and producing a qualitatively different stable state.
