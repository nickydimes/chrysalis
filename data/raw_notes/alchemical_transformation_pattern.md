## Purification
The alchemical nigredo (blackening) is the first operation: the prima materia must be purified through calcination — heating until all volatile components are driven off and only ash remains. Eliade documents that metallurgical cultures worldwide share this pattern: the ore must be "killed" (smelted, dissolved in acid, ground to powder) before it can be transformed. Jung interpreted the nigredo as the psychological confrontation with the shadow — the parts of the psyche that have been repressed or denied. The purification is painful because it requires the destruction of the current form. The alchemists were explicit: "No generation without corruption" (generatio et corruptio).

## Containment
The alchemical vessel — the vas hermeticum — is the essential container. It must be sealed (hence "hermetically sealed") to prevent the volatile spirit from escaping during the transformation. The vessel must withstand the heat of the process without cracking. Jung emphasized that the vessel is the therapeutic relationship itself: the analyst and analysand create a sealed container within which psychological transformation can occur. Without the vessel, the dissolution is merely destruction. The vessel transforms destruction into possibility.

## Anchoring
The "philosophical mercury" (Mercurius) serves as the alchemical anchor — the principle of transformation itself that persists through all the color changes and phase transitions of the opus. Mercury is simultaneously the agent, the process, and the goal of the work. In Jungian terms, the Self (as opposed to the ego) is the invariant that persists through the dissolution of ego-structures. The alchemists encoded this in the ouroboros — the serpent eating its own tail — a symbol of the cyclical invariant that is both the starting point and the endpoint.

## Dissolution
The albedo (whitening) follows the nigredo: the calcined matter is dissolved in the "philosophical water" (aqua permanens). What was solid becomes liquid; what was fixed becomes volatile. The alchemists called this the solutio — the dissolution of the old form. The silver-white color indicated that purification was complete: all dross had been removed. Jung read this as the dissolution of rigid ego-structures and the emergence of the anima/animus — the contrasexual elements of the psyche that had been repressed by the dominant ego-identity. The dissolution is not destruction but liquefaction — the material is transformed, not annihilated.

## Liminality
The alchemical "peacock's tail" (cauda pavonis) represents the liminal phase: a dazzling display of rapidly shifting colors that appears in the vessel between the albedo and the rubedo. The material is in maximal flux — neither the old white form nor the final red form. The alchemists warned that this was the most dangerous phase: the temptation to stop the process and admire the beautiful colors (inflatio — identification with the luminous contents of the unconscious). Jung associated this with the archetypal encounter with the collective unconscious — a state of maximal numinosity and maximal danger.

## Encounter
The rubedo (reddening) begins with the coniunctio — the union of opposites. Sol (gold, masculine, conscious) and Luna (silver, feminine, unconscious) are joined in the vessel. The alchemical texts describe this in frankly sexual imagery, but the underlying structure is the encounter between two previously separated principles. What is encountered is not something entirely new but something that was always present in latent form — the complementary opposite that completes the system. In physics terms, the encounter is with the broken-symmetry partner: the state that the spontaneous symmetry breaking did not select.

## Integration
The multiplication and projection phases of alchemy describe integration: the philosopher's stone, once created, is "multiplied" — its potency increased through repeated cycling of the process — and then "projected" onto base metal to transmute it. Jung interpreted this as the integration of the individuated Self into everyday life: the transformed psyche must function in the ordinary world, and the process of transformation must be repeatable. The stone is not a final product but a catalyst — it transforms what it touches without being consumed. Integration means the transformation becomes self-sustaining.

## Emergence
The lapis philosophorum (philosopher's stone) is the emergent product of the opus — a substance that does not exist in nature and cannot be produced by any simple combination of ingredients. It requires the full sequence of operations: nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, rubedo. The stone is described as paradoxical: it is common and precious, known and unknown, visible and invisible. Jung saw this as the symbol of the individuated Self — a psychological configuration that integrates conscious and unconscious, masculine and feminine, individual and collective into a whole that transcends its components. The emergence is irreversible: the adept who has produced the stone is permanently transformed.
