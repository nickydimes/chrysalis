Binary spins on a square lattice interact ferromagnetically. At the **Onsager critical temperature** T_c ≈ 2.269 J/k_B:\n\n- Below T_c: spins align spontaneously → **magnetization** emerges (symmetry breaking)\n- At T_c: the system is scale-invariant — fluctuations of all sizes coexist\n- Above T_c: thermal noise destroys order → paramagnetic phase\n\nThe Wolff cluster algorithm dramatically reduces critical slowing down compared to single-spin Metropolis updates.\n\n**Exact exponents** (Onsager, 1944): β/ν = 1/8, γ/ν = 7/4, ν = 1\n\n**Protocol mapping**: Temperature sweeps from ordered (Purification) through the critical point (Liminality) to the disordered phase (Emergence of new order upon cooling)."

Each spin can point in one of three directions, and neighbors interact when aligned. This seemingly small change puts the system in a **different universality class** — the critical exponents change, but the qualitative phenomenology (divergent susceptibility, scale invariance, scaling collapse) is identical.\n\n**Key difference from Ising**: The Potts transition at q=3 is still continuous in 2D but is right at the boundary — for q > 4 it becomes first-order (discontinuous). This makes it a sensitive test case.\n\n**Exact exponents** (Baxter): β/ν = 2/15, γ/ν = 26/15, ν = 5/6, T_c ≈ 0.995\n\n**Protocol mapping**: Same structure as Ising, but the Z₃ symmetry means three equivalent ground states compete during Dissolution, and the system must \"choose\" during Encounter — a richer symmetry-breaking landscape.",

Each lattice site is independently occupied with probability p. Clusters form by nearest-neighbor connectivity.\n\nAt the **percolation threshold** p_c ≈ 0.5927, a giant spanning cluster first appears — connecting opposite boundaries. This is a purely geometric transition, yet it exhibits the same phenomenology: divergent susceptibility, power-law cluster sizes, finite-size scaling collapse.\n\n**Exact exponents** (Nienhuis, den Nijs): β/ν = 5/48, γ/ν = 43/24, ν = 4/3, τ = 187/91\n\n**Protocol mapping**: The occupation probability p plays the role of control parameter. At p_c, the system is in Liminality — the largest cluster is fractal (neither finite nor space-filling). The Encounter is the moment a spanning cluster first connects distant regions.",
