Based on the aggregated ethnographic data and the Eight-Step Navigation Protocol, I propose the following three testable research hypotheses:

1. **Critical Element Triggering**: The occurrence of structural dissolution (observed in 100% of records) is directly correlated with the transition from the Anchoring phase to the Dissolution phase in the protocol. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the probability of structural dissolution increases significantly when the system is in the Anchoring phase, and this increase can be modeled using a percolation simulation with a critical threshold (p < 0.05). This hypothesis can be tested by analyzing the spatial distribution of structural dissolution events in relation to the protocol phases.

2. **Phase Transition Synchronization**: The simultaneous occurrence of Anchoring and Emergence protocol phases (each observed in 100% of records) indicates a synchronized phase transition, which is likely triggered by the Riverbend Flood event. It is hypothesized that this synchronization can be modeled using an Ising model simulation, where the magnetic field represents the flood event, and the spin variables represent the protocol phases. The hypothesis predicts a significant increase in the synchronization of Anchoring and Emergence phases when the system is subjected to a critical level of "magnetic field" (flood intensity) (p < 0.01). This hypothesis can be tested by analyzing the temporal correlations between the protocol phases and the flood event.

3. **Liminality Threshold**: The absence of explicit mentions of Liminality in the key summaries, despite its presence in the protocol, suggests that this phase may be characterized by a threshold effect. It is hypothesized that the system must exceed a critical threshold of structural dissolution (e.g., 50% of the system's structure) to enter the Liminality phase. This hypothesis can be tested using a Potts model simulation, where the number of states represents the protocol phases, and the interaction energy represents the structural dissolution. The hypothesis predicts that the probability of entering the Liminality phase increases significantly when the system exceeds this critical threshold (p < 0.05). This hypothesis can be tested by analyzing the distribution of structural dissolution levels in relation to the occurrence of Liminality.

These hypotheses provide a starting point for further investigation into the complex relationships between the ethnographic observations and the Eight-Step Navigation Protocol, using phase transition simulations as a theoretical framework.
