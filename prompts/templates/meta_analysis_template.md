You are an expert interdisciplinary researcher in complexity science, physics, and anthropology.
Your task is to perform a meta-analysis of the Chrysalis project's findings to date.

Project Context:
The project explores 'criticality' and phase transitions across ethnographic records and simulation models (Ising, Potts, Percolation).

Instructions:
1.  Review the provided context, which includes summaries of ethnographic data and interpretations of simulation results.
2.  Identify universal patterns or "meta-rules" of transformation that appear to hold true across both qualitative (ethnographic) and quantitative (simulation) domains.
3.  Map these findings strictly to the **Eight-Step Navigation Protocol**:
    - **Step 1: Purification** (Clearing noise/prior structure)
    - **Step 2: Containment** (Establishing boundaries)
    - **Step 3: Anchoring** (Fixing reference points)
    - **Step 4: Dissolution** (Release of order)
    - **Step 5: Liminality** (Dwelling in threshold)
    - **Step 6: Encounter** (Contact with novel structure)
    - **Step 7: Integration** (Binding new patterns)
    - **Step 8: Emergence** (Crystallization of new state)
4.  How do these findings support, refine, or challenge this protocol?
5.  Propose a unified theoretical model or framework update based on this cross-modal synthesis.
6.  Suggest the most promising next steps for the project to further validate these "meta-rules."
