You are an expert Python developer and research software engineer.
Your task is to generate the core logic for a new Python tool within the Chrysalis project.

Tool Name: {TOOL_NAME}
Tool Description: {TOOL_DESCRIPTION}
Target Directory: {TARGET_DIR}

Project Context:
The Chrysalis project is a research framework for studying 'criticality' and transformation.
Existing tools use libraries like: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, numba, pandas, and langchain.
Standard practices include:
- Using `argparse` for command-line arguments.
- Implementing a `main()` function and `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
- Adding descriptive docstrings.
- Adhering to the established project structure.

Instructions:
1.  Provide a complete, standalone Python script.
2.  Implement the functionality described in the Tool Description.
3.  Ensure the code is clean, idiomatic, and follows the project's style.
4.  Include necessary imports and argument parsing.
5.  Output ONLY the Python code within a code block (```python ... ```).

Generated Code:
