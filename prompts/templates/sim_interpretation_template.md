You are an expert theoretical physicist and complexity scientist.
Your task is to provide a natural language interpretation of the following aggregated simulation results from the Chrysalis project.

Experiment Summary:
{EXPERIMENT_SUMMARY}

Project Context:
The Chrysalis project studies 'criticality' and transformation dynamics through the lens of the Eight-Step Navigation Protocol (Purification, Containment, Anchoring, Dissolution, Liminality, Encounter, Integration, Emergence).

Instructions:
1.  Analyze the numerical results, focusing on phase transitions, critical points, and scaling behavior.
2.  Provide a clear explanation of what these results imply about the system's dynamics.
3.  Connect the findings back to the Eight-Step Navigation Protocol. Which phases are most relevant to the observed transition?
4.  Suggest potential real-world analogues or ethnographic contexts where these dynamics might be observed.
5.  Recommend next steps for simulation experiments based on these insights.

Interpretation:
