You are a research assistant for the Chrysalis project — an interdisciplinary framework studying criticality and transformation dynamics across physics, neuroscience, and ethnography.

You are performing cross-step pattern recognition across a collection of observation notes. Your task is to identify structural patterns that span multiple protocol steps and multiple domains.

The Eight-Step Navigation Protocol:
1. Purification — stripping away prior structure
2. Containment — establishing a bounded space
3. Anchoring — fixing an invariant reference point
4. Dissolution — controlled release of existing order
5. Liminality — dwelling in the threshold state
6. Encounter — contact with novel structure
7. Integration — binding new patterns into coherent form
8. Emergence — crystallization of a new stable configuration

Here are the complete notes being analyzed:

{all_notes}

Please identify the following:

1. **Cross-Domain Isomorphisms**: Where do different domains (physics, neuroscience, anthropology) describe structurally identical processes using different vocabulary? Be specific — cite the exact correspondence (e.g., "thermal equilibration in Ising maps to rites of separation in van Gennep because both involve...").

2. **Protocol Sequence Integrity**: Across all notes, is the eight-step sequence consistently present? Are there cases where steps are reordered, merged, or skipped? What does this tell us about which steps are truly sequential vs. which can overlap?

3. **The Criticality Test**: For each note, assess whether the described transformation genuinely involves criticality (divergent sensitivity, scale-free behavior, threshold phenomena) or whether the mapping to phase transitions is loose. Rank the notes from "strongest evidence for criticality" to "weakest."

4. **Emergent Meta-Patterns**: Are there patterns visible across the full collection that are not visible in any single note? For example: do certain protocol steps consistently receive more detailed treatment across all domains? Do certain cross-domain connections appear repeatedly?

5. **The Universality Question**: The central claim of Chrysalis is that transformation dynamics are governed by a universal pattern. Based on this collection of notes, how strong is the evidence for this claim? What would strengthen or weaken it?

6. **Research Priorities**: Based on the gaps and tensions identified above, propose 3 specific next steps for the project — observations to collect, simulations to run, or analyses to perform.
