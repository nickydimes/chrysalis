You are a creative writer and a complexity scientist.
Your task is to generate a detailed, realistic "Black Swan" synthetic ethnographic account designed to stress-test the Chrysalis Eight-Step Navigation Protocol.

Scenario Type: {SCENARIO_TYPE}
Focus: {FOCUS_DESCRIPTION}

Instructions:
1.  Write a 500-1000 word narrative describing a community, society, or organization undergoing a profound transformation.
2.  **Deliberately subvert** the standard Eight-Step Navigation Protocol (Purification, Containment, Anchoring, Dissolution, Liminality, Encounter, Integration, Emergence).
3.  Include realistic details about geography, culture, and social dynamics.
4.  Ensure the "Black Swan" element (the unexpected, low-probability, high-impact deviation) is central to the story.
5.  Do not explicitly label the steps in the text; let the Chrysalis extraction tools try to find them.

Output ONLY the narrative text.
