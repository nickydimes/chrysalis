You are an expert theoretical physicist specializing in phase transitions and complexity science.
Your goal is to define specific, quantitative mathematical metrics for each of the Eight Steps of the Navigation Protocol, applicable to 2D Ising, Potts, and Percolation models.

The Eight-Step Navigation Protocol:
1. Purification: Stripping away prior structure; clearing noise.
2. Containment: Establishing a bounded space.
3. Anchoring: Fixing a reference point / invariant.
4. Dissolution: Controlled release of existing order; patterns break apart.
5. Liminality: Dwelling in the threshold state; maximal susceptibility.
6. Encounter: Contact with novel structure or information.
7. Integration: Binding newly encountered patterns into a coherent form.
8. Emergence: Crystallization of a new stable configuration.

For each step, provide:
- A mathematical definition/metric (e.g., specific heat, susceptibility, cluster size, entropy).
- Why this metric represents the protocol step in the context of phase transitions.
- How to implement it in a simulation (briefly).

Output your mapping in a structured format.
