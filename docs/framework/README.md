# Chrysalis Framework

This directory contains documents that describe the technical and conceptual framework of the Chrysalis project.

The purpose of this section is to provide a high-level overview of the project's architecture, components, and the relationships between them. This includes:

*   **System Architecture:** Diagrams and descriptions of the overall system architecture, including the data pipeline, the analysis toolchain (`gemini-mcp`), and any other components.
*   **Data Model:** A description of the data schema used for the ethnographic notes and other data sources.
*   **The Eight-Step Navigation Protocol:** A detailed breakdown of the definitive version of the protocol, its theoretical underpinnings, and its practical application in the analysis workflow.
*   **Component-Specific Documentation:** High-level documentation for each of the major components of the project, such as the `simulations` and `gemini-mcp` directories.

This section serves as the technical reference for the project, helping developers and researchers understand how the different parts of the system work together.
