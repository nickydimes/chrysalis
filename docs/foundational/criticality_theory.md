# Theories of Criticality and Phase Transitions

## Overview
Criticality is a state of a system in which it is at a point of transition between order and disorder. In statistical physics, this is most clearly seen in **second-order (continuous) phase transitions**, where a system's macroscale properties change abruptly but continuously as a control parameter (like temperature) is varied.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Phase Transitions
*   **First-Order:** Discontinuous changes in the order parameter (e.g., water boiling to steam). Features latent heat and phase coexistence.
*   **Second-Order:** Continuous changes in the order parameter (e.g., a magnet losing its magnetization at the Curie temperature). Characterized by scale invariance and divergent fluctuations.

### 2. Universality
Universality is the observation that systems with completely different microscopic dynamics (e.g., spins in a magnet vs. molecules in a liquid) exhibit identical behavior near their critical points. This behavior is captured by **critical exponents**, which depend only on:
*   The dimensionality of the system.
*   The symmetry of the order parameter (e.g., Z₂ for Ising, O(2) for XY).
*   The range of interactions.

### 3. Scale Invariance and Power Laws
At criticality, a system has no characteristic scale. Fluctuations exist at all sizes, from the microscopic to the size of the entire system. This scale invariance manifests as **power-law distributions** in observables like correlation length, susceptibility, and (in percolation) cluster sizes.

### 4. Renormalization Group (RG)
The Renormalization Group is the mathematical framework that explains universality. It involves "zooming out" from the system and observing how its properties change. At criticality, the system reaches a **fixed point**, where its behavior is independent of microscopic details. Parameters that don't change the fixed-point behavior are called *irrelevant*, while those that do are *relevant*.

### 5. Self-Organized Criticality (SOC)
Proposed by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld, SOC describes systems that automatically tune themselves to a critical state without external intervention (e.g., a sandpile reaching a stable slope). This concept is vital for understanding how complex systems, from forests to brains to societies, maintain a state of high sensitivity and adaptability.

## Relevance to Chrysalis
Chrysalis uses these physical theories as a formal language to describe sociocultural and psychological transformations. By modeling human "transitions" as phase changes, we can leverage the mathematical rigor of universality to find common patterns across diverse domains of experience.
