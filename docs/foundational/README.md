# Foundational Documents

This directory contains the core theoretical and conceptual documents that form the foundation of the Chrysalis project.

The documents in this section should explore the fundamental principles and ideas that underpin the project's interdisciplinary approach, including:

*   **Theories of Criticality:** Papers and notes on phase transitions, self-organized criticality, and other relevant concepts from physics.
*   **Neuroscience of Consciousness:** Research on the "edge of chaos" in the brain, models of consciousness, and the neural correlates of transformational experiences.
*   **Philosophical and Anthropological Frameworks:** Texts that provide a conceptual language for understanding transformation, liminality, and emergence in human systems.

The goal of this section is to provide a rich theoretical background for any researcher or developer working on the Chrysalis project.
