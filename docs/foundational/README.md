# Foundational Documents

This directory contains the core theoretical and conceptual documents that form the foundation of the Chrysalis project.

The documents in this section explore the fundamental principles and ideas that underpin the project's interdisciplinary approach:

*   **[Theories of Criticality](criticality_theory.md):** Exploring phase transitions, universality classes, and the Renormalization Group.
*   **[The Critical Brain Hypothesis](critical_brain_hypothesis.md):** Research on the "edge of chaos" in the brain and models of cognitive dynamic range.
*   **[Anthropological Frameworks](anthropological_frameworks.md):** Conceptual language for understanding transformation, liminality, and the Eight-Step Navigation Protocol.

The goal of this section is to provide a rich theoretical background for any researcher or developer working on the Chrysalis project.
