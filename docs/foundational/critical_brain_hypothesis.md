# The Critical Brain Hypothesis

## Introduction
The critical brain hypothesis proposes that the biological brain operates near a critical point of a phase transition. In this state, the brain balances two extremes:
*   **Subcriticality:** Activity dies out too quickly, making the system unresponsive and "quiet."
*   **Supercriticality:** Activity explodes into seizure-like runaway excitation, making the system unstable and "noisy."

## Core Principles

### 1. The Edge of Chaos
By operating at the "edge of chaos," the brain maximizes its **dynamic range** — its ability to respond to inputs across many orders of magnitude. This state also optimizes:
*   **Information transmission:** How far a signal can propagate before fading.
*   **Information storage:** The variety of patterns the system can support.
*   **Computation:** The complexity of the transformations the network can perform.

### 2. Neuronal Avalanches
The hallmark of criticality in the brain is the **neuronal avalanche**. These are bursts of activity that follow power-law distributions in both size and duration. First observed by Beggs and Plenz (2003) in cortical slices, these avalanches demonstrate that brain activity has no characteristic scale, much like the fluctuations in a magnet at T_c.

### 3. Branching Processes
The simplest model for this behavior is a **branching process** on a network. Each active neuron has a probability of activating its neighbors. The average number of subsequent activations is the **branching ratio (σ)**:
*   σ < 1: Activity is transient and local.
*   σ = 1: The critical state, supporting scale-free avalanches.
*   σ > 1: Runaway excitation.

### 4. Adaptive Tuning (Metaplasticity)
How does the brain stay critical? Biological mechanisms like **synaptic scaling** and **inhibitory feedback** act as self-organizing controllers, constantly "tuning" the network back to the critical point when it drifts away.

## Connection to Transformation
In the Chrysalis framework, the "critical brain" provides the neural substrate for transformational experiences. States of high sensitivity (Liminality) often involve a shift in neural dynamics toward (or perhaps through) a critical point, where old patterns of connectivity dissolve and new ones can emerge. This allows us to link ethnographic reports of "expanded consciousness" or "identity shifts" to measurable changes in neural dynamic range.
