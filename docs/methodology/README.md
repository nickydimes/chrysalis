# Research Methodology

This directory contains documents that outline the research methodology used in the Chrysalis project.

The purpose of this section is to ensure that the project's research is conducted in a rigorous and systematic way. This includes:

*   **Data Collection protocols:** Guidelines for collecting ethnographic and historical data, including interview techniques, observation methods, and ethical considerations.
*   **Data Analysis Workflow:** A step-by-step description of the process for analyzing the collected data, from raw notes to synthesized insights. This should include details on how the `supernote_parser.py` script and the `gemini-mcp` toolchain are used.
*   **Validation and Verification:** Procedures for validating the findings of the analysis and ensuring the integrity of the research.
*   **Simulation Methodology:** A description of the methodology used for the physics-based simulations, including the models used, the parameters explored, and the interpretation of the results.

This section provides the "how-to" guide for the research aspect of the project, ensuring that the work is transparent, repeatable, and of high quality.
