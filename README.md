# Chrysalis

An interdisciplinary research framework and toolset dedicated to the study of **criticality** -- the emergent properties that appear when structures dissolve.

Chrysalis posits that the dynamics of transition states -- physical phase transitions, consciousness at the boundary of order and disorder, and the "in-between" of creative breakthroughs -- are governed by a universal pattern. By synthesizing insights from physics, neuroscience, and ethnographic records, this project aims to model the structure of boundary conditions and build tools for analyzing transformation dynamics.

## Project Goals

- **Framework Development:** Synthesize cross-disciplinary insights to model the structure of boundary conditions where transformation occurs.
- **Protocol Testing:** Codify and stress-test the Eight-Step Navigation Protocol used to facilitate deliberate transformation.
- **Tool Building:** Develop Python-based tools for analyzing and visualizing transition dynamics, treating cross-cultural and historical accounts as structured data for pattern recognition.

## The Eight-Step Navigation Protocol

The protocol describes a sequence of phases observed across physical, psychological, and cultural accounts of transformation at critical boundaries.

| Step | Phase | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Purification** | Stripping away prior structure; clearing noise so the system can approach a critical threshold. |
| 2 | **Containment** | Establishing a bounded space (physical, psychological, or formal) that holds the system while coherence dissolves. |
| 3 | **Anchoring** | Fixing a reference point -- an invariant -- that persists through the transition and prevents total dissolution. |
| 4 | **Dissolution** | The controlled release of existing order; the system enters the critical regime where old patterns break apart. |
| 5 | **Liminality** | Dwelling in the threshold state itself -- maximal susceptibility, long-range correlation, and emergent possibility. |
| 6 | **Encounter** | Contact with novel structure or information that was inaccessible from within the prior ordered state. |
| 7 | **Integration** | Binding newly encountered patterns into a coherent form; the system begins to re-order around new attractors. |
| 8 | **Emergence** | Crystallization of a new stable configuration that could not have been predicted from the prior state alone. |
