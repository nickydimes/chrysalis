# Neural-Socio Mapping Summary

## Quantitative Convergence
- **Social Size Exponent (tau_s):** 1.27
- **Neural Size Exponent (tau_s):** 1.50
- **Social Duration Exponent (tau_d):** 1.59
- **Neural Duration Exponent (tau_d):** 2.00

## Qualitative Interpretation
The proximity of social cascade exponents to neural branching exponents suggests that information spread in social networks and avalanche propagation in the brain share the same universality class (Mean-Field Directed Percolation).

### Protocol Mapping
1. **Liminality (Step 5):** Social cascades are most critical when the network is at the 'tipping point' of connectivity.
2. **Emergence (Step 8):** Large-scale social coordination emerges from local interactions, mirroring neural synchrony.
