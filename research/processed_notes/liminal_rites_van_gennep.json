    "Purification": "Van Gennep's \"rites of separation\" (rites de séparation) systematically strip the initiate of their prior social identity. Among the Ndembu of Zambia, Turner documents how novices are removed from their village, their everyday clothing taken, their bodies smeared with white clay (mpemba) — the color of death and liminality. Names may be changed or temporarily erased. The Maasai moran shave their heads before entering the warrior camp. These are not merely symbolic acts — they dismantle the neural and social patterns that constitute the previous self. The parallel to thermal equilibration is structural: you cannot approach the critical point from an arbitrary configuration without first erasing the memory of the old state.",
    "Containment": "The ritual space provides containment. Turner calls it the \"betwixt and between\" — a bounded zone that is neither the old world nor the new. The sacred grove, the kiva, the vision-quest isolation site, the monastic cell. These are finite-size systems: the container constrains how far the dissolution can propagate. Without containment, the initiate risks genuine psychic dissolution (psychosis in clinical terms, supercritical runaway in physics terms). The ritual elders serve as boundary conditions — experienced guides who have traversed the transition before and can maintain the container's integrity.",
    "Anchoring": "In nearly every documented rite of passage, there is an anchor — an invariant that persists through the dissolution. For the Ndembu, it is the mudyi tree (milk tree), whose white sap represents matrilineal continuity. For Australian Aboriginal walkabout, it is the songline — a geographic-narrative structure that predates and outlasts any individual journey. For monastic traditions, it is the rule (e.g., the Rule of St. Benedict) — a fixed framework of daily practices that holds through the dissolution of worldly identity. The anchor prevents the liminal state from becoming pathological. It is the lattice on which the new structure will crystallize.",
    "Dissolution": "Turner's concept of \"communitas\" describes the dissolution of social structure within the liminal phase. All prior distinctions — rank, kinship, wealth — are temporarily suspended. The initiates are reduced to a homogeneous, undifferentiated group. Turner calls this \"anti-structure.\" In the Eleusinian Mysteries, participants consumed kykeon and entered the Telesterion — a hall of darkness where normal perceptual categories dissolved. The Tibetan bardo teachings describe an analogous dissolution of the five aggregates (skandhas) of selfhood. What dissolves is not random — it is specifically the structures that maintained the prior configuration.",
    "Liminality": "The liminal state itself is the critical point of the ritual. Turner describes it as \"a realm of pure possibility whence novel configurations of ideas and relations may arise.\" The liminal person (liminoid entity) is structurally invisible — no longer classified by the old system, not yet classified by the new. Among the Ndembu, the mudyi tree ritual produces a state of maximal ambiguity: the initiate is simultaneously dead and unborn. The parallel to critical fluctuations is precise — at T_c, the system is neither ordered nor disordered, and fluctuations on all scales mean the system can reorganize in any direction.",
    "Encounter": "In the liminal space, the initiate encounters something genuinely new — knowledge, vision, or experience that was structurally inaccessible from within the prior social position. The Eleusinian epopteia (the supreme vision) was said to permanently transform the initiate's relationship to death. Aboriginal dreamtime encounters during walkabout connect the individual to ancestral knowledge embedded in landscape. Zen kensho (seeing one's true nature) arises only after the dissolution of conceptual frameworks through prolonged zazen. The encounter is not learning in the ordinary sense — it is access to a configuration space that was previously unreachable.",
    "Integration": "The \"rites of incorporation\" (rites d'agrégation) bind the new knowledge into a stable social and psychological configuration. The initiate receives a new name, new clothing, new social role. Among the Ndembu, reintegration involves specific prescribed behaviors, food restrictions, and spatial arrangements that gradually re-establish structure — but a different structure than before. The process is not instantaneous: Turner documents that post-liminal individuals often undergo a period of gradual integration where the insights of the liminal state are tested against the requirements of ordinary social life.",
    "Emergence": "The initiated person is qualitatively different from the uninitiated — this is the universal claim of rites of passage across cultures. The Maasai elder is not simply an older version of the moran; the structure of social relations, obligations, and knowledge has undergone a genuine phase transition. Van Gennep's key insight was that this transformation requires the full three-phase sequence: separation, transition, incorporation. You cannot skip from the old state to the new. The new configuration emerges from the liminal dissolution, not from incremental modification of the old. This is the hallmark of a first-order-like transition with hysteresis — the path matters, not just the endpoint."
