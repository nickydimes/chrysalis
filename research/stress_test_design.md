# Chrysalis Stress-Test Design: Black Swan Scenarios

To robustly test the Eight-Step Navigation Protocol, we generate synthetic ethnographic accounts that intentionally deviate from the idealized linear progression of transformation.

## 1. Scenario Archetypes

| Archetype | Description | Stress Goal |
|---|---|---|
| `The Stuck Liminal` | A community enters Liminality but cannot find an Encounter. They cycle between Dissolution and Liminality indefinitely. | Test how the framework handles lack of convergence. |
| `The Sudden Emergence` | A system skips from Containment directly to Emergence due to a massive external shock (e.g., total regime change). | Test handling of missing protocol steps. |
| `The Reversing Phase` | A village reaches Integration, but an failure in Anchoring causes them to regress back to Purification. | Test handling of non-linear/recursive transformations. |
| `The Overlapping Encounter` | Multiple conflicting Encounters happen during a single Liminal phase, creating noise rather than order. | Test handling of high-entropy transitions. |
| `The Shadow Protocol` | A transformation where steps are malicious or parasitic (e.g., Purification is actually a purge). | Test the ethical and semantic boundaries of the framework. |

## 2. Evaluation Metrics
- **Extraction Reliability:** Can the LLM still structure this "broken" data?
- **Simulation Suggestion:** Does the LLM suggest a model that reflects the *failure* (e.g., high noise, no transition)?
- **Meta-Analysis:** Does the synthesis tool correctly identify these cases as anomalies?
