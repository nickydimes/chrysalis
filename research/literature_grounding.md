**Evaluation of Hypothesis 1:**

Hypothesis 1 posits that during the transition from traditional farming to aquaculture and sustainable fishing in Riverbend Village, the phase of Dissolution plays a crucial role. It suggests that beyond a critical threshold of old social structures dissolving, there is a significant increase in the adoption of new economic practices, modeled using Percolation simulations.

**Supporting Evidence:**
- **Granovetter's Threshold Models:** This theory supports the idea of a critical mass needed for collective action or change. Granovetter’s work on thresholds in collective behavior aligns with the hypothesis, indicating that once a certain number of individuals break away from traditional norms, it can lead to widespread change.
- **Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations:** This theory highlights how new ideas spread when a threshold is reached, supporting the hypothesis's assertion about increased adoption after dissolution.

**Potential Conflicts:**
- **Granovetter also noted that excessive dissolution without concurrent structure formation might lead to instability.** Thus, while dissolution can drive change, it must be accompanied by new structures to avoid negative outcomes.
- Some studies suggest that transitions depend on context; mere dissolution isn't sufficient without supportive factors for innovation.

**Academic Plausibility:**
The hypothesis is grounded in existing theories about thresholds and network dynamics, giving it a medium-high academic plausibility. However, its specificity to Riverbend Village necessitates local empirical validation to generalize findings beyond the community.

**Conclusion:**
Hypothesis 1 is plausible with existing theoretical support but requires empirical evidence from Riverbend Village to confirm its applicability and explore potential pitfalls like instability without new structures.
