# Chrysalis Manuscript Structure (LaTeX)

This document defines the expected structure for automatically generated research papers.

## 1. Front Matter
- **Title:** Generated based on the primary ethnographic event and simulation model.
- **Authors:** Chrysalis Research Framework (and user-defined authors).
- **Abstract:** Synthesis of the transition, model findings, and alignment with the Eight-Step Protocol.

## 2. Main Body
- **Introduction:** Project context, the Eight-Step Protocol, and the specific research question.
- **Methods:**
    - Ethnographic Ingestion & Qualitative Analysis.
    - Simulation Model Details (Ising, Potts, or Percolation logic).
    - Statistical methods (Ensemble averaging, Critical point detection).
- **Results:**
    - Quantitative findings (Order parameter, Susceptibility).
    - Protocol Signature interpretation.
- **Discussion:** Cross-modal synthesis (connecting physics to culture), hidden relationships from Knowledge Graph.
- **Conclusion:** Validation of the protocol and future directions.

## 3. Back Matter
- **References:** Citations from the Grounding Report.
- **Appendices:** Parameter tables, additional snapshots.
